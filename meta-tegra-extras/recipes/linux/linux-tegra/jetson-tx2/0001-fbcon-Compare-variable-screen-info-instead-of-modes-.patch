Subject: [PATCH] fbcon: Compare variable screen info instead of modes (FIX)

Previous commit changed behavior, so that when trying to match a mode to a
variable screen info structure, the mode was first converted to a variable
screen structure rather than the variable screen info structure to a mode.

However, when new mode was being added to the modelist, matching was still
being done using mode structure. This could cause situation, where existing
mode would match when comparing with mode structure, but not when compared
using variable screen info structure. This would eventually result in a
NULL pointer dereference in fbcon_switch.

Fix the issue by using the variable screen info structure also when adding
new mode to the modelist.
